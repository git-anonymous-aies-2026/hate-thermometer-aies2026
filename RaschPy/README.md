# RaschPy
_RaschPy_ is a Python package for Rasch analysis which can estimate parameters for a variety of Rasch models, generate a range of model fit statistics and output tables and graphical plots. _RaschPy_ also contains simulation functionality (used for the simulations in this work). _RaschPy_ is open source and free to download. Specifications are subject to change as the software is developed; the details listed here are correct at the time of writing (January 2024). The following is not intended to be a user manual, or even fully comprehensive at the time of writing, but rather to highlight the main functionality of _RaschPy_. A full navigable manual is available in the GitHub repository. A basic Excel spreadsheet demonstrating the PAIR algorithm for dichotomous data is also available, following the example of the Moulton JMLE dichotomous demo available via https://www.rasch.org/moulton.htm  (and using the same set of responses - the final results are compared to the Moulton JMLE output).

## Models
_RaschPy_ has a parent class `Rasch` for analysis, with the following child classes for different Rasch models:
- `SLM` for the simple logistic model (dichotomous Rasch model) (Rasch 1960)
- `PCM` for the partial credit model (Masters 1982)
- `RSM` for the rating scale model (Andrich 1978)
- `MFRM` for the many-facet Rasch model (rating scale model formulation) (Linacre 1994), including extended rater representations (Elliott and Buttery 2022a)

## Analysis
To analyse data, create an object of in the appropriate class, passing a pandas dataframe of response data as an argument along with other arguments relevant to the chosen Rasch model, such as the maximum score for `RSM` or `MFRM`, or a vector of maximum scores for `PCM`. At the time of writing, the `RSM` and `MFRM` classes only support a single response group (i.e. all items must have the same threshold structure), and the `MFRM` class only supports one additional facet for rater severity. Parameter estimation uses variants of PAIR (Choppin 1968, 1985), the eigenvector method (Garner & Engelhard 2002, 2009) and CPAT (Elliott & Buttery 2022a, 2022b).
